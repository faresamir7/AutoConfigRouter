## Description

Automated Configuration of Cisco and Fortinet firewalls with a python based application with a user friendly web interface

## Motivation

Setting rulesets for firewalls is a time-consuming repetitive process that can be shortened with automation, that being said, Cisco remains the problematic odd one since imports are not supported in NGFWs even in CLI whereas the other three support either CLI-based scripts or .xls importing and exporting.
Thus I'm creating an automated orchestrator that allows rapid configuration using .xls imports following a certain template.

## Basic Requirements

* Python >= 3.7
* FirePower Cisco Appliance with FTD/FMC/FDM software installed
* Fortinet Firewall
* More firewalls to come!

## Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then [WIP]
